## Description

The CO2 Emissions Prediction Project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating CO2 emissions of automobiles based on various attributes. The project utilizes linear regression models to establish relationships between CO2 emissions and factors such as engine size, fuel consumption, and more. By predicting CO2 emissions, the project aims to provide insights into environmental sustainability and guide decision-making towards greener practices in the automotive industry.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/co2-emissions-prediction.git](https://github.com/justA-Noobdev/CO2-emissions-using-Liner-Regression.git)
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib scikit-learn pandas numpy ipython jupyter
  ```

## Usage

To use the model you have 2 different jupyter notebooks.

1. SLR.ipynb is for Simple Linear Regression.
2. MLR.ipynb is for Multiple Linear Regression.

## Models

The project employs both simple and multiple linear regression models. Simple linear regression establishes a relationship between CO2 emissions and a single predictor, while multiple linear regression considers multiple predictors simultaneously. The models were trained and evaluated using the Scikit-learn library.

## Results

The CO2 emissions prediction models achieved promising results, with a mean squared error (MSE) of X and an R-squared value of X. The models demonstrated a significant correlation between CO2 emissions and key predictors, highlighting the impact of factors such as engine size and fuel consumption. Further insights and visualizations can be found in the jupyter notebooks.
